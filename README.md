🍽️ TasteWish Dish Generator
A smart and user-friendly web application that suggests recipes based on user-selected ingredients and cuisine. Built as part of an internship project using **Python (Flask)** and **HTML/CSS/JS**.

📌 Project Description

**TasteWish Dish Generator** is a mini project that allows users to enter the ingredients they have and choose a preferred cuisine (Indian, Italian, or Chinese). Based on this, the app suggests a suitable recipe from a curated database, displaying cooking time, ingredients, difficulty level, and step-by-step instructions

🎯 Project Goals

* ✅ Create an interactive recipe recommendation system
* ✅ Filter data dynamically using user inputs
* ✅ Build a seamless UI/UX experience
* ✅ Demonstrate full-stack web development with **Python + JS**
